## Note
It seemed more appropriate to keep the front-end and back-end together in one repository, but they were developed independently and are not truly dependant on one-another.

philly-phorum-front is the react-apollo front-end

philly-phorum-back is the node local server back-end

Persistent storage and user authentication through the awesome [Prisma!](https://www.prisma.io/) service. Details to come...

## In progress
authentication,

live, persistent hosting and data storage,

security fixes,

branding changes
